I told ChatGPT to create a burger in p5js with all of the specifications in the homework, and it created a bunch of shaky circles that went to diffent spots when you clicked. This is interesting because I don't think ChatGPT focused too hard on making it look like a burger. It instead focused on the specifications and tried to meet each one. It did create the right colors for the ingredients of the burger tho, such as lettuce being green. I think it did that and though that matching the colors was enough to make it look like a burger. Lastly, it wasn't very creative in moving the shapes around in my opinion.
